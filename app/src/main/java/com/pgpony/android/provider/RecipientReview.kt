// RecipientReview.kt
// PGPony Android 4.7.0 (item 41, #25)
//
// The rules behind the provider's recipient review, kept free of Android types
// so they can be unit tested. When a mail app asks PGPony to encrypt to an
// address it has no usable key for, the provider opens
// ProviderRecipientReviewActivity instead of failing the send (OpenKeychain's
// "Please review the list of recipients"). The client then re-runs the same
// operation with EXTRA_KEY_IDS_SELECTED, and these rules decide which of those
// ids may join the recipients already resolved.
//
// Item 10 holds throughout: a key marked Don't use is never offered and never
// accepted from EXTRA_KEY_IDS_SELECTED, and an address whose only key is
// marked Don't use is shown as such rather than as missing.
